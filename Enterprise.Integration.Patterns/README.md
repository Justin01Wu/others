# summary on the book Enterprise Integration Patterns

Interesting applications rarely live in isolation.

All integration solutions have to deal with a few fundamental challenges:
+ Networks are unreliable
+ Networks are slow
+ Any two applications are different
+ Change is inevitable

Over time, developers have overcome these challenges with four main approaches:
+ File Transfer:  FTP, import, export
+ Shared Database
+ Remote Procedure Invocation: RPC, RMO, API
+ Messaging


Messaging is a technology that enables high-speed, asynchronous, program-to-program communication with reliable delivery.

The following are some main decision criteria.
+ whether to use application integration at all
+ Application coupling
+ Intrusiveness
+ Technology selection
+ Data format
+ Data timeliness
+ Data or functionality
+ Remote Communication
+ Reliability
